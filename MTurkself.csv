Last night was a special occasion so there was good food and as much as I could eat.  I went way overboard on the calories and pretty much set myself back a week of dieting.  After the event was over I got pretty upset with myself for not remaining strong enough to resist the food.,3,3,1,2,1,3,1,3,1,2,1,1,I guess I need a break every now and then as dieting all the time is pretty mentally taxing.  Maybe I can learn from my mistakes and make better choices next time.,3,2,4,1,2,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,5,1,2,1,1,3,3,2,5,3,2,2,1,5,1,1,1,1,1,1

Yesterday the bus driver went right past my stop even though I had rang the bell and there were people waiting at the stop. I yelled that I wanted that stop yet he continued up the street. He finally lets me off and I confront him on why he didn't stop. He claimed that the stop was closed, but I take that stop everyday and told him there were no signs and people were waiting there on top of it. He replied that his notes said it was closed and that he could get in trouble for stopping there when it is closed. Some people were able to run to catch up with the bus but others weren't. I confirmed that the stop was not closed, but by that time the bus was gone. I would have reported it but I didn't get the bus ID number written down so I didn't bother. It just really upset me because I knew I was right, and he was going out of his way to mess up 3 people's day. I guess I should have reported it because it still bothers me and now I'm afraid they are going to skip my stop again.",2,2,2,4,3,3,4,4,1,4,2,2,"The situation isn't all that important in the grand scheme of things, it was just frustrating. It wasn't so much negative to me, but I don't know if those people were trying to make it to an appointment or something. The silver lining is that it didn't really affect me, I still got home at the same relative time. I could learn to not get shaken up over trivial things such as this, because everyone makes mistakes and not everyone is nice to interact with. This was very much a temporary situation, and hopefully a one time issue.",1,1,1,1,4,3,3,4,4,1,4,2,2,5,1,2,2,1,3,2,2,4,2,3,2,2,5,1,1,2,1,1,2

I've been using it for awhile now with good results. I had an opportunity to bring this up and share, but did not. This is typical of me to remain silent and in the background, rather than call attention to myself. It is also why I never consciously take leadership roles (though somehow end up with them sometimes) or progress professionally.

They were search tasks where you had to search phrase that you typed in, and couldn't copy and paste, once you found the right site the phrase belonged to, you had to make sure you were on the right site, then you had to stay on the site for a certain amount of time. Then you had to click on a captcha. And you are timed to do all this. So what happened is that the time ran out. And when I went back to do the task again, I skipped all the steps since I had already done them. But since the first time didn't count, they didn't know that I had gone through the task thoroughly, and I'm assuming they go by their timer as the only way of knowing the time I spent. 

I don't know why I am upset about a few cents that I lost, but when you work for pennies, every penny counts. I want to get past worrying about every little cent I miss out on, but it's the principle of the thing. I could contact requester and explain my side of the story, but that would cause more trouble than those hits are worth.
